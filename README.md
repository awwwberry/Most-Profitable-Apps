## Introduction to My Project <a name="introduction"></a>
The goal of this project is to profile the most popular and profitable apps in both the App Store and Google Play Market.

In this project, my company makes apps that are free to download and install. We rely on attracting many users to the app to earn revenue from in-app ads. Building data driven profiles will help guide our ios and Android developers on what apps to build in the future.

This is a guided project from DataQuest where I practice the basics of data analysis. 

## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>
Android apps [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) from Google Play store containing approximately 10,000 apps, collected in August 2018.
iOS apps [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) from Apple App store containing approximately 7,000 apps, collected in July 2017.

## Languages
In this project I used [Python](https://www.python.org/) language.
